                <h2>What's this blog all about?</h2>
                <p>
                    This blog is a development blog that will share my ideas/experiences using and developing for the Sitecore CMS platform, and also the occasional random post on general ASP.NET/Microsoft stack topics.

                <h2>Why "Core Blimey"?</h2>
                <p>
                    I've just used a play on words with Sitecore. "Cor Blimey" is an exclamation of surprise derived from "God blind me"!

                    If you've ever seen the film Mary Poppins, it's the kind of thing you'd expect Bert (the cockney jack of trades) to say if for example his hat blew off in the wind.

                    This blog is not in anyway related to packaging, ab workouts or a film documenting the relationship between Carry On actors Barbara Windsor and Sid James...Well, not yet anyway!
